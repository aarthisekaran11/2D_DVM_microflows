Output format:
   
   Bird: 
   	 for unsteady flow sampling, if continuing with a new sample and outer boundary is stationary
	 ISF = 0, IRUN = 2, IVB = 0
	 code prompts distribution sampling
	 Asks for output intervals, ISET
	 
	 for unsteady flow sampling, code calls SAMPLE_FLOW if FTIME > TSAMP

	 if FTIME > TOUT, code calls OUTPUT_RESULTS and if IDSISTS > 1 OUTPUT_DISTRIBUTIONS

	 INITIALISE SAMPLES - sets counting variables to 0
	 INITIALISE DISTRIBUTIONS - sets distribution variables to 0 (assumes homogeneous)

	 SAMPLE FLOW - 
	 	sums vibrational energy
		loops over all particles and calculates n,u,v,w,u^2,v^2,w^2,Erot,Evib

	 OUTPUT RESULTS - 
	 	calculates flowfield properties
		starts at reflected/incident molecules boundaries and then loops over all cells
		creates sums from sampled data
		calculates VARSP and VAR from sums and other sampled data
		for unsteady flow sampling, INITIALISE_SAMPLES is called inside the subroutine
		profile data is output to PROFILE.DAT

	 OUTPUT DISTRIBUTIONS - 
	 	outputs sampled distribution and equilibrium distribution calculated from temperature
		TRANSDIST.DAT, ROTDIST.DAT, VIBDIST.DAT
